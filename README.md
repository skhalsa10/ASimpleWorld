# ASimpleWorld

Hello

To use this code just download processing(the java version) for your computer.

You can download it from here:

https://processing.org/

After downloading Processing. You should be able to double click ANY file in the folder 
SimpleWorldController. It will open all needed files in Processing. If Processing IDE does not pop up automatically then open processing IDE and from inside this window go to File-open and choose any file in the SimpleWorldController folder.

You can press play to see what my code does. You can also change the code and make it better!

Show me what you make if you change it! :)

Cheers,

Siri
